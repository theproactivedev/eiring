# Eirin Gonzales

I'm a front end developer who can also handle back-end and database tasks. I've worked with various codebases from Umbraco setup, React web application powered by AWS and WordPress setup with Vue.

I also got experience working with database management such as MSSQL and MySQL. I got personal projects using Mongoose.

If there's anything I need to learn to work on your codebase, I do my research learning and playing with it.

If you need a front end developer, email me at eiringonzales@gmail.com.
